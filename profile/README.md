## Welcome to the GitHub of the Inserm UMR Right lab

This space is dedicated to hosting the reproducible codebase and computational workflows underpinning the lab’s scientific publications. Each repository is tied to a published study or preprint, providing open access to scripts, pipelines, and analysis tools.

Additionally, a comprehensive directory of the bioinformatics team, coordinated by [Baptiste Lamarthée, PhD](https://github.com/BaptLabRight), is maintained below, listing each member’s role, expertise, and contact information for analysis requests from lab members and collaboration inquiries.
